            <p class="game-desc">Project VRmor aims to blend the gaming and simulator industries together to let a player control their characters actions with their bodies and minds. This will be accomplished by merging the latest and greatest virtual reality tech available into one suit. Skyrim and Battlefield will be used to demonstrate the system (with limits as they were not designed for VR) until RPG and military style demos are created to demonstrate the fullest extent of the system.</p>
